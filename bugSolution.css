The correct way to use the `calc()` function is to always enclose the entire calculation within parentheses. For instance, if you want to calculate a width that is 100% of the container minus 20px, the correct syntax is:

```css
width: calc(100% - 20px);
```

Incorrect usage would be:

```css
width: calc 100% - 20px; /* Incorrect */
```

This applies to more complex calculations as well. Always ensure that all operations are within the parentheses.
